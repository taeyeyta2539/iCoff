Coffea arabica (/əˈræbɪkə/), also known as the Arabian coffee, "coffee shrub of Arabia", 
"mountain coffee", or "arabica coffee", is a species of Coffea. It is believed to be the 
first species of coffee to be cultivated, and is the dominant cultivar, representing some 
60% of global production. Coffee produced from the less acidic, more bitter, and more 
highly caffeinated robusta bean (C. canephora) makes up the preponderance of the balance.
